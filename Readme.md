## Intro

testssl.sh is a free Unix command line tool which checks a server's service on 
any port for the support of TLS/SSL ciphers, protocols as well as some cryptographic flaws.
It's designed to provide clear output for a "is this good or bad" decision.

It is working on every Linux distribution which has OpenSSL, /bin/bash and
standard tools like GNU sed and awk installed.

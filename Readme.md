## Intro

testssl.sh is a free command line tool which checks a server's service on 
any port for the support of TLS/SSL ciphers, protocols as well as some cryptographic flaws.
It's designed to provide clear output for a "is this good or bad" decision.

It is working on every Linux distribution, MacOS X and Windows (using MSYS2) which has OpenSSL,
/bin/bash and standard tools like GNU sed and awk installed.

On github (here) you will find development versions of the software -- with new features and maybe some bugs. For the stable version and a more thorough description of the software please see http://testssl.sh/ .

Contributions, feedback, also bug reports are welcome.
